I'm using this mobile since a week...

*Design is good but it is little slippery. But built quantity is very good. Front and back with Corning Gorilla glass 5, top and bottom with metal. But sides are made of plastics which i think is bummer for me. It should have been metal Sony!
*No lag noticed till now and i won't b able to because it is having the best processor from Snapdragon!
*Nougat 7.1.1 is nicely implemented by Sony.
*Both the cameras are good. Day light shots come excellent but in low light it still falls behind of iPhone, Samsung and Pixel.
*Previously when i was using Sony l, heating was the main issue, but now the phone runs cool even under light to medium graphics intensive games.
*Battery life is crazy! I'm getting 2 full days of usage if i use normally and a full day if i use heavily. My SOT always stood above 7.5 to 8 hours. However if you use Wi-Fi you can expect more than 9 hours of SOT, you can see in the photo attached with this review. I always use my phone with Stamina mode in a balance mode along with data saver kept on and with greenify app.

**For 60k you can get S8 and if you spend little more you can get S8+. I was using S7 edge and i got bored with Samsung's UI so bought XZ Premium.

I'm very happy with my purchase.
