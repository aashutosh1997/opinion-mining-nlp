The configurations tested base-model 1920 x 1080 screen higher-end 2560 x 1440 display, latter comes Nvidia G-Sync technology. The expensive panel definitely worth premium, thanks superior brightness sharpness. Alienware 17 R4The base-level 1080p screen sharp colorful, bright accurate competitors. I played Mass Effect: Andromeda brightness turned way up, still seemed bit dark. A blue Asari tad purple, I could see every pore Sara Ryder's face. The game looked better 1440p G-Sync screen, Asari perfect shade blue game sharp. Turning brightness way important first step I watched 1080p trailer movie Gifted base screen. Once I got sorted out, Octavia Spencer's bright-pink shirt popped brown pew sits watching custody trial, Chris Evans' unruly beard sharp face. When I watched trailer 1440p screen, I even need brightness halfway maximum, details vivid. In tests, base screen 1440p screen covered strong 113 percent 114 percent sRGB color gamut, respectively, matching Aorus X7 falling short 120-percent desktop-replacement average. The ROG Dominator Pro within percentage points Alienware panels, Razer Blade Pro reproduced astonishing 185 percent.

The Nvidia GTX 1070 GPU 8GB VRAM packs quite performance punch, GTX 1080 version Alienware machine even powerful. The 3.5 x 2.2-inch touchpad feels bit cramped, especially much room deck, accurate enough room Windows 10 gestures. I could pinch zoom photos, scroll browsers flick programs minimized state quickly easily. Audio The audio Alienware 17 bit muffled. When I listened "How Far I'll Go" Disney's "Moana," Auli'i Cravalho's voice crystal clear, though drums orchestra behind detailed. I much luck playing presets multimedia section Alienware Sound Center, I found default gaming setup provided much-needed boost volume. I recommend sticking matter listening to. I better luck games. I kept Alienware gaming default profile running I played Mass Effect: Andromeda. I found plenty loud, characters' voices, background orchestration intergalactic gunshots balanced. Gaming, Graphics VR The cheaper Alienware 17 Nvidia GTX 1070 GPU 8GB VRAM pack quite performance punch, version GTX 1080 even powerful. With either configuration, able play intense games high settings, even get buttery-smooth VR performance. Using GTX 1070 model, I played Mass Effect: Andromeda mix high medium settings, game almost always ran 100 frames per second -- often high 160 fps -- combat conversation scenes, albeit occasional tearing rendering issues.

The average 9.3, Aorus X7, ROG Dominator Pro scored 10 11. The Blade Pro matched expensive Alienware, 11. Performance When gaming, get serious work done either Alienware 17 configuration tested. First, I tried lower-end model, 2.8-GHz Intel Core i7-7700HQ CPU, 16GB RAM, 128GB SSD 1TB HDD. With unit, I 40 tabs open Google Chrome, two showing Twitch streams high quality never saw hint lag. You expect even better performance model reviewed, 2.9-GHz Intel Core i7-7820HK, 16GB RAM, 512GB PCIe SSD 1TB HDD. If care storage speed, get 512GB PCIe SSD. The cheaper Alienware 17 notched score 14,020 Geekbench 4 overall performance test. That beats desktop-replacement average (12,792) lower ROG (14,717; Intel Core i7-7820HK) Aorus X7 (16,411 Intel Core i7-6820HK). The expensive Alienware 17 achieved score 14,154, beating Blade Pro (11,702). If care storage speed, get Alienware 17 base-level 128GB mSATA SSD. The configuration tested 128GB SSD took glacial 1 minute 2 seconds copy 4.97GB mixed media files, hard-drive-like rate 83.4 MBps. However, higher-end Alienware 17 configuration 512GB PCIe SSD sped along reasonable 282 MBps. Both SSDs significantly slower category average (480.9 MBps) Aorus X7 (462.7 MBps), Dominator Pro (628.6 MBps) ROG G752VS (727.04 MBps) far faster PCIe SSDs. The less expensive Alienware completed OpenOffice spreadsheet macro, pairs 20,000 names addresses, 3 minutes 21 seconds. It quicker average (3:30) Dominator Pro (3:37), speedy Aorus X7 (3:09) ROG (2:51). The pricier Alienware fastest (1:47), blowing away Razer Blade Pro ( 4:06). Most configurations Alienware 17 come Tobii eye tracking, consists several infrared sensors sit display. When activate Tobii's EyeX software, used navigate Windows 10 controller favorite games. My favorite uses Tobii ones gaming. I set screen dim I walked away computer, saving precious battery life. I also able several windows open scroll one I looking matter screen mouse was. Less useful ability move mouse anywhere screen look tap, cool party trick save ton time. It's really cool control computer eyes. It feels like future, even yet must-have. Tobii currently works 49 games, including Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Wildlands, Watch Dogs 2 Tom Clancy's The Division. I tried Rise Tomb Raider Lara Croft infiltrated Soviet base. At first, I feel eye tracking much, I boosted sensitivity game's options, I could swing camera around eyes (albeit precisely I'm used controller). Additionally, I could shoot enemies looking them, locked every guard I encountered. To go crucial headshot, I still move reticle pulling trigger. As bonus, Tobii uses infrared technology, use camera Windows Hello log facial recognition. It's really cool control computer eyes. It feels like future. But implementation games still feels, many ways, like party trick, must-have. If want it, customize base configuration without Tobii Eye Tracking save $75 (see Configurations section, below). Battery Life You'll able game longer low-level Alienware 17 competitors; lasted 8 hours 32 minutes Laptop Mag Battery Test, involves continuous web surfing Wi-Fi. That's much longer desktop-replacement average 4:43, competitors paltry comparison. The ROG endured 3:53, Dominator Pro survived 3:18 Aorus X7 petered 2:23. The expensive version, however, lasted 2 hours 45 minutes, though that's 1 minute longer Razer Blade Pro. Heat Even started gaming, Alienware 17 got bit hot collar. After streamed HD video YouTube 15 minutes, touchpad reached 85 degrees Fahrenheit, center keyboard G H keys measured 91.5 degrees. However,the bottom reached 96 degrees, vents climbed high 100 degrees. Both latter temperatures 95-degree comfort threshold. After I played Mass Effect: Andromeda, got much hotter. While center keyboard touchpad change much, bottom vents measured steamy 124.5 degrees. Webcam The 1080p webcam Alienware 17 takes sharp photos, they're dark. In selfie I snapped sitting desk, face covered shadows. My brown sweater appeared far darker real life, light sources ceiling blown out. I could make facial features dimple, streaming Twitch, opt external webcam. Software Warranty There's useful gaming software preinstalled, there's also bloat. The big draw Alienware Command Center, lets change colors RGB lights, adjust power plan, customize macro keys, create custom profiles depending game play adjust settings graphics amplifier. The Killer Networking control center another great tool lets prioritize programs get access network. As bloat, usual stuff see baked Windows 10: Candy Crush Soda Saga, Minecraft: Windows 10 Edition, Twitter, Facebook, Paradise Bay Sling TV. Dell sells Alienware 17 R4 one-year warranty.

Configurations The Alienware 17 R4 available wide variety configurations, order Dell, even choose screen (1080p, 2K 4K), storage drive(s), RAM, CPU GPU (GTX 1070 1080). Whatever buy, recommend avoid disappointingly slow 128GB SSD spend least extra $150 configure 256GB PCIe SSD larger. It's also good idea step dim 1080p screen. One two models I reviewed, $1,949.99 Alienware 17 R4, sports Intel Core i7-7700HQ CPU; 16GB RAM; Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 GPU 8GB VRAM; Tobii IR eye tracking; 1080p display; 128GB SSD; 1TB, 7,200-rpm HDD. We also tested $2,599.99 version Intel Core i7-7820 HK CPU; 16GB RAM; Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 GPU; quad-HD G-Sync display;a 256GB PCie SSD; 1TB, 7,200-rpm HDD. The $1,299.99 base model includes Core i7-7700HQ CPU; 8GB RAM; Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 Ti GPU 2GB VRAM; 1TB, 7,200-rpm HDD, eye tracking. This model ton customization options Dell's website (you even make configuration I reviewed, without Tobii eye tracking), good place start want powerful options. Bottom Line The Alienware 17 R4 offers great combination strong performance, comfortable typing, innovative eye tracking attractive design. With lower-end components, may also get all-day battery life and, optional graphics amp, get even stronger performance. Alienware 17 R4The high-end, $2,599 configuration Alienware 17 R4 tested best 17-inch gaming laptops market, including Asus ROG G752VS OC Edition, costs $100 less similar specs uses lower-resolution screen GTX 1070 rather GTX 1080 graphics card. However, $1,949 configuration tested suffered dim 1080p screen rather slow SSD. As premium brand, Alienware really offering cut-rate components price. Fortunately, avoid issues configuring Alienware 17 faster storage drive brighter, higher-res screen.
