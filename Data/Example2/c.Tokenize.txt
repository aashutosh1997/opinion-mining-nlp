Google focused on making these the smartest phones ever.', 4: "And based on my testing over several days, the new Pixels aptly fit that description, with a versatile Google Assistant you can now summon with a squeeze and a new object-recognition feature in the camera app that's truly impressive.", 5: 'Available either through Verizon or unlocked, the Pixel 2 (from $649) and Pixel 2 XL ($849) also offer top-notch performance and battery life, as well as excellent photo quality.', 6: 'Other one-of-a-kind smart features are on the way, including Pixel Buds headphones you can use as a universal translator.', 7: 'However, the designs of these pure Android Oreo phones are anything but sweet, and we wish carriers other than Verizon sold these sequels directly.', 8: '"Send it back \xe2\x80\x94 it still needs more bezel!"', 9: "That\xe2\x80\x99s how I imagine the insane conversation about the regular Pixel 2 took place at Google's headquarters.", 10: 'At a time when other phones are stretching their screens to reach practically from one corner to the other, the front of the Pixel 2 is a throwback in the worst possible sense of the word.', 11: 'Seeing the Pixel 2\xe2\x80\x99s gorgeous 5-inch OLED screen sandwiched between such large blocks of black glass is downright offensive.', 12: 'I measured the top and bottom bezels at over 0.6 inches, compared to 0.2 inches for the Galaxy S8.', 13: 'Seeing that gorgeous 5-inch OLED screen sandwiched between such large blocks of black glass is downright offensive.', 14: "It's not all bad news, though, as the two front-firing stereo speakers get nice and loud, offering richer audio than the speaker on the bottom edge of the Galaxy S8.", 15: "Plus, if you're adamant that a phone be easy to use with one hand, you'll prefer the Pixel 2's more-compact dimensions of 5.7 x 2.7 x 0.3 inches, versus 6.2 x 3 x 0.3 inches for the Pixel 2 XL.", 16: 'The Pixel 2 weighs a fairly light 5 ounces, compared to 6.2 ounces for the Pixel

0.35 inches thick, respectively.', 19: 'This handset also sports stereo speakers above and below the screen.', 20: "Around back, you'll find Google\xe2\x80\x99s trademark two-tone design on both

in the center, beneath the stripe, making it easy to reach.', 22: 'Google offers a range of colors for the Pixel 2, including Just Black, Clearly White, Black and White (which reminds us of the cookie), and Kinda Blue.', 23: 'The Pixel 2 XL comes in Just Black and Black and White.', 24: 'Unfortunately, neither the Pixel 2 nor the Pixel 2 XL features a headphone jack.', 25: "Google includes a

using it just for a few minutes, I changed my mind.', 28: 'With a firm, quick squeeze toward the bottom of the phone, you can activate Google Assistant, which is faster and more accurate and versatile than Siri.', 29: 'With the Assistant just a squeeze away, I had no problem finding out how the Yankees were doing against the Astros (not great), telling the Pixel 2 to snap a selfie or seeing the photos I took that day.', 30: 'For instance, I said, "Play BoJack Horseman on my living room TV," and Google Assistant on the Pixel 2 launched the Netflix app right to this deranged cartoon on my big

viewing solid colored backgrounds.", 45: "A user setting lets you boost colors to make them more vivid, but it's limited; Google says that a coming software update will let you further boost the

present.", 47: "We have not noticed this issue ourselves, but it's still concerning.", 48: "Again, Google promises a software update that it will claims will optimize a feature aimed at maximizing the life of the Pixel's display.", 49: "And it's extending the warranty on its Pixel phones to two years.", 50: 'The Pixel 2 XL is the phone you want to have outdoors, as it registered a higher 438 nits

Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL offer always-on displays, which show you the time and notifications at a glance.', 54: 'But the new Pixels go even further, with a Now Playing feature that can recognize music playing in the background and automatically display the title and artist.', 55: 'From there, you can double tap the track to learn more about the song or to play it.', 56: "It sometimes took 30 seconds or more for Now Playing to kick in, but it's not designed to replace Shazam; it's more about serendipitous discovery.", 57: "While the cameras on the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL take great-looking images, that's not what really makes the photo experience stand out.", 58: 'That would be Google Lens, an object-detection feature in the Camera and in Google Photos app.', 59: 'With Google Lens, the Pixel 2 can recognize landmarks with ease, such as the Flatiron Building in New York City.', 60: 'I just snapped a photo, then tapped on the lens icon on the bottom of the screen; Google Assistant then displayed an information card on the building with info from Wikipedia.', 61: 'I had mixed results when taking pictures of businesses.', 62: "After I took a shot of the neon sign for Gleason's Tavern, Google Assistant gave the the star rating and a brief description of the establishment, along with its hours of operation.", 63: "But Google Lens didn't recognize the sign for Dough, which is a premium donut shop.", 64: 'Google Lens worked pretty well on a business card; the phone easily picked up the email address of the contact and his phone number.', 65: 'Last but not least, I tried

images.", 70: "Cameras and Image Quality: Great, but no iPhone 8 killer\n\nConsidering the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL sport single rear 12-megapixel cameras, you might think that they're snapping pics with one arm tied around their backs compared to dual-lens camera phones.", 71: 'Nope.', 72: "They aren't, and that's because these phones are smart enough to offer a Portrait mode (bokeh effect)

money.', 74: 'In one portrait I took of my colleague Cortney with the Pixel 2, the New York City skyline blurred into the background, but not too much \xe2\x80\x94 just enough for her red-orange hair, blue shirt and green jacket to pop.', 75: "As I zoomed in, though, I noticed that one part of a building behind her didn't have the blur effect.", 76: "It's too bad that you can't preview Portrait Mode results in real time, as you can with the iPhone 8 and Galaxy Note 8; the bokeh effect is applied after you take the shot.", 77: 'In terms of overall image quality, the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 Plus give the best camera phone, the iPhone 8 Plus, a run for its money.', 78: "But they don't surpass it.", 79: "In this shot of the Flatiron Building, the Pixel 2's HDR+ setting brought out more details in the shadows than the iPhone 8 Plus did.", 80: "The iPhone's image has a bit better contrast, but overall, the Pixel 2's image is the one I would share on Facebook or Instagram.", 81: 'The iPhone 8 Plus pulled ahead with this shot of an outdoor art piece.', 82: 'The iPhone 8 Plus delivered a brighter image with more vibrant oranges, blues, purples and pinks.', 83: 'Indoors, at the Lego store, it was a toss-up between the Pixel 2 and iPhone 8 Plus.', 84: "The image of a Lego man in a top hat captured by Google's phone delivered more-realistic hues, while Apple's camera delivered a brighter image.", 85: 'The iPhone 8 Plus won on this close-up of a lantana flower.', 86: "The image turned out brighter than the Pixel 2 XL's shot, making it easier to tell that the sun was shining, although I could make out a great amount of detail in the leaves on both photos.", 87: "If you're an Android fan and you've been jealous of Apple's Live Photos, you'll get a kick out of the Motion photos feature on the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 Plus.", 88: 'It captures a few seconds of video with each image and plays it back with a loop-like effect, as I noticed in one shot I took that had moving cars in the foreground.', 89: 'With the same Snapdragon 835 processor as the Galaxy S8 and the same 4GB of RAM as the Galaxy S8 and S8+, the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL might be expected to offer the same performance.', 90: "Actually, they're faster in real-world tasks.", 91: 'On our video-editing test, in which we transcode a 2-minute 4K video clip to 1080p in the Adobe Clips app, the Pixel 2 took 2

are just way too big and it's screen too small for me to take this phone seriously, even for its relatively low $649."}
